# Agency Landing
> Agency Landing is a free PSD template. 
> I decided to create this website as a personal codetask. I set up a few goals during this task: 
> 1. to train myself in making good Accessability for the website; 
> 2. to implement BEM methodology;
> 3. to learn SASS;
> 4. to implement JS code in website and learn how to work with DOM.

Hope, you will enjoy this site. Thanks!
