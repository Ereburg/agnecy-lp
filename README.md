# Agnecy Landing Page
This is a test website. Agnecy based on pure HTML, Sass and a bit JS. Also you can find free PSD template (see link in reference). I made this site as a part of personal code tasks. I set up a few goals during this task: 
1. to practice with BEM methodology;
2. to practice in writing in SASS syntax;
3. to learn how to implement accessibility on the website; 
4. to implement JS code on website and learn how to work with DOM.

Hope, you will enjoy this site. Thanks!
